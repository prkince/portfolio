      perso_title: "Personal Achievement"
      perso_text_html: "
        <p> My career in logistics in a really specific field has taught me how to excel in a competitive market and how to efficiently organize my work.
        </p>
        <p> <strong> Context:</strong> A few years back, I noticed incessant issues with some of our foreign partners. We were facing inefficient and unreliable work, irregularities in the services offered, we were losing market shares and clients.
        </p>
        <p> Most of them were based in the USA, by then we needed to establish new partnerships, to set up a powerful working supplier relation and improve our process of communication.
        </p>
        <p> <strong> Solution:</strong> To achieve that, I focused on our main markets locally (New York and Los Angeles areas), and carefully contacted long time partners as well as new ones. After validating the budget and setting up all meetings, it was time for me to travel. Being there for a few days was incredibly rewarding: I was then able to secure a market which was going down and came back with new clients and suppliers.
        </p>
        <p> <strong> Attainment:</strong> I now know for a fact that in order to build strong and trustworthy relationships, we need to extend our network, be curious and never be afraid of going further.</p>"
